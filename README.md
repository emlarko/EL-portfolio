# CSS Challenge - Portfolio

## Description

This aim of this project was to create a portfolio of deployed websites for potential employers to view. 
As well as examples of work, there is a photo, a short about me and contact information.

# Usage

The navigation bar of the website contains links to each section on the portfolio. 
In the 'work' section of the webiste, when each image is clicked, it will take the user to that deployed website - the two bottom images are placeholders. 
The footer of the webpage contains contact information. When the user clicks on email, they will be directed straight to their email app. The other links direct the user to the corresponding website.
